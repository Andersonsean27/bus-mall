# User Stories

## As a Marketing Research Team, We:

1. Want to collect data that is sound and valid, so we can know how to make decisions about what products we promote. 
2. Want a website for the focus group that is attractive and functional, so that we can make sure we are collecting the best data. 
3. Want a focus-group study that displays all of our products, so that consumers have a chance to compare all options. 
4. Want each and every product photo to be of comparable quality, so that every product has a fair opportunity for selection. 

## As a Developer, I Want:

1. To design a site that is attractive and functional, so focus-group participants will want to participate and take the process seriously. 
2. To display products in a random, non-repeating manner, so that the data is more valid. 
3. To track user inputs and present the data as charts, so that there is an easy way for the marketing research team to make conclusions about their products. 
4. To not present user input until the end of the study, to ensure that data is not "tainted".

## As a Focus Group Participant, I Want: 

1. To engage with a site that is attractive and functional, so that I can remain interested. 
2. To be presented with a variety of products, so that I feel like my choice matters.
3. To Receive the results of my selections, so I can get a better idea of what kinds of products I am interested in. 
4. To not see the same product over and over again, so I don't get bored.
